Hi there! My name is Orkhan Alishov and I'm a Software Engineer, currently living in Baku, Azerbaijan.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Baku State University, and my primary focus and inspiration for my studies is Web Development.

I'm self-motivated and constantly experimenting with new technologies and techniques.

Everything PHP, Laravel, JavaScript and Vue related is my :heartpulse:
